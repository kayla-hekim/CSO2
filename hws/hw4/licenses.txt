licenses.txt

Licenses considered:

1. MIT License
A permissive license allowing reuse, modification, and distribution with minimal requirements (primarily preservation of the copyright
and license notice). No warranty provided.

2. Apache License 2.0
A permissive license similar to MIT but with more explicit patent licensing terms and requirements about preserving notices.

3. GNU GPLv3
A copyleft license requiring that derivative works distributed to others must also be licensed under GPLv3 and provide source code.

Choice:
I chose the MIT License because it is short, simple, and permissive, which is appropriate for a small educational codebase where I want
others to be able to read and reuse the code easily.
