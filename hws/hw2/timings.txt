Scenario 1: empty function call
Estimated time: 1.009 nanoseconds
Method: Averaged 1000 samples of 10000 function calls per sample. Measured timing calls separately using an empty loop and subtracted it from the total run trial times before dividing by the number of calls (10000)

Scenario 2: random number generator with drand48()
Estimated time: 6.364 nanoseconds
Method: Same as scenario 1 above (1000 samples of 10,000 calls; subtract empty-loop timing overhead; divide by 10,000)

Scenario 3: perform getppid() on current process
Estimated time: 124.487 nanoseconds
Method: Same as scenario 1 above (1000 samples of 10,000 calls; subtract empty-loop timing overhead; divide by 10,000)

Scenario 4: perform retInParent() which forks & returns in parent
Estimated time: 97141.000 nanoseconds
Method: Averaged 300 samples with 1 function call per sample. Measured only fork() return in parent and waitpid() ran after timing and (not included). Subtracted measured timing calls from total time

Scenario 5: waitpid() when child already terminated
Estimated time: 21770.000 nanoseconds
Method: Forked a child that immediately exited before timing started, slept around 1ms to ensure termination, then only waitpid() was timed. Subtracted timing calls from total time. Same samples and only 1 function call like Scenario 4
Raw data: rawTimings5.txt


Scenario 6: fork, terminate child, then do waitpid, all within the timing session this time
Estimated time: 350302.000 nanoseconds
Method: Timed entire operation including fork(), child exit, and waitpid(). Same samples and only 1 function call like Scenario 4

Scenario 7: perform system(/bin/true)
Estimated time: 12032712.000 nanoseconds
Method: Timed system() call directly. Same samples and only 1 function call like Scenario 4
Raw data: rawTimings7.txt


Scenario 8: create then remove directory within /tmp on portal
Estimated time: 21573.000 nanoseconds
Method: Timed mkdir() followed by rmdir() in /tmp. Same samples and only 1 function call like Scenario 4
